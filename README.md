## KyokaSignal

This bot was made for the YKZA FanScans server. No clue if they're gonna use it but it's here...

If they are gonna use it, get it with [this link](https://canary.discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=832143666679382057&permissions=134144&scope=bot). Don't use that link if you aren't putting it in the YKZA server or you will be wildly disappointed. That bot is specifically for the YKZA server so all of the bits and bobs have been hardcoded for them.

If you want to use it in your server, self-host it! `config.js` contains all of the stuff you need to change to get this to work. They have been commented to make it easy to know what does what.

## How it works

- Using `<ping` will return your generic ping command with a little fortune near it.
- Using `<call` or `<signal` will ping the person who's user/role ID is in `config.js` 5 times(If you use the pre-made bot, the user is Kyoka).
- Using `<help` will tell you all of these commands.
Note that you can use the first letter in all of these commands as a shorter version(ie. `<p` is the same as `<ping`)

### Alright...
That's all, enjoy the bot!
